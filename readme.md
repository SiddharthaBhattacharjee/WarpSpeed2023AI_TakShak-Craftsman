ResqAI is an innovative call management system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help prioritize emergency calls when no handlers are available. By analyzing the keywords and recording the location of callers, ResqAI can grade the importance of each call and quickly transfer the relevant information to the respective handler. This system helps emergency services to respond more efficiently and effectively to urgent situations.

## ‚ú® Features

- AI-powered call management: ResqAI uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to identify the urgency of each call and prioritize them accordingly.
- Call grading based on keywords: ResqAI grades each call based on the keywords spoken by the caller. This allows the system to quickly identify urgent calls and transfer them to the emergency handler.
- Location tracking: ResqAI also records the location of each caller and provides this information to the handler.
- Call transcript: ResqAI provides a transcript of each call to the emergency handler, allowing them to quickly and accurately assess the situation and respond accordingly.
- Automated responses: In some cases, ResqAI can provide automated responses to callers to guide them through emergency situations until an emergency handler is available.

## ü§î The problem faced by most of us today

In emergency situations, every second counts. However, when the emergency call center is overwhelmed or understaffed, callers may have to wait for a long time before their call is answered. This delay can be critical and could result in a loss of life or property. Our hackathon project, ResqAI, solves this problem by using artificial intelligence to grade the importance of each call and transfer the relevant information to the emergency handler. This helps emergency services to respond more efficiently and effectively, potentially saving lives and reducing property damage.

## ‚úÖ How ResqAI Works

When a caller dials the handler and there are no available handlers, the call is automatically redirected to the ResqAI system. The system then asks the caller to describe the emergency situation and uses NLP and ML algorithms to analyze the content of the call. Based on the keywords and phrases used by the caller, the system grades the importance of the call and assigns it a priority level.

If the call is urgent, ResqAI will immediately transfer the relevant information to the handler. This information includes the caller's location, a transcript of the call, and any other relevant details. If the call is less urgent, ResqAI may provide automated responses to guide the caller through the situation until a emergency handler is available.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Installation and Usage
To use ResqAI, simply integrate the system with your emergency services call center. The system can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of your organization. ResqAI is compatible with most modern phone systems and can be configured to work with any existing emergency call management software.
